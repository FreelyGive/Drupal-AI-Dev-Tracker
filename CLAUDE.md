# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Drupal CMS** - a ready-to-use platform built on Drupal 11 core with smart defaults and enterprise-grade tools for marketers, designers, and content creators. The project uses a recipe-based architecture for modular content types and features.

## Development Environment

This project uses **DDEV** for local development with deployment to **Drupal Forge** via **DevPanel**:

- **Local Development**: DDEV environment
  - **Project Type**: Drupal 11
  - **PHP Version**: 8.3
  - **Database**: MariaDB 10.11
  - **Webserver**: nginx-fpm
  - **Document Root**: `web/`

- **Deployment Workflow**:
  1. Develop locally with DDEV
  2. Push changes to GitHub
  3. Deploy to Drupal Forge via DevPanel (has its own build scripts)

- **Database Changes Policy**:
  - **Long-term changes**: MUST use database update hooks (`drush updb`) so they can be deployed to production
  - **Debugging scripts**: Can be used for temporary database changes during development
  - **Production updates**: Always use `drush updb` on live site after deployment

- **Production Deployment**:
  - **Dependencies**: Use `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` to exclude testing dependencies
  - **Testing Dependencies**: All testing packages (phpunit, behat, etc.) are in `require-dev` section
  - **Code Quality Tools**: Development tools like `drupal/coder` are dev-only dependencies
  - **Live Site Sync**: Only production dependencies are installed on live/staging environments

- **Git Commit Policy**:
  - Use developer's name and email for commits
  - Include mention of Claude/AI assistance in commit descriptions when applicable
  - **NEVER stage changes (`git add`) until user has tested and explicitly asked for commit**
  - **NEVER commit changes until user explicitly confirms with phrases like "yes commit" or "go ahead and commit"**
  - Always let user verify functionality before staging files
  - Wait for explicit confirmation before committing

## Architecture Overview

### Recipe-Based System
Drupal CMS uses a **recipe system** for modular functionality:

- **Base Recipe**: `drupal_cms_starter` - foundational setup with admin UI, authentication, and basic features
- **Content Type Recipes**: Each content type (blog, news, events, etc.) is a separate recipe
- **Feature Recipes**: Additional functionality like SEO tools, search, forms, etc.

Key recipe components:
- `recipe.yml` - defines dependencies, modules to install, and configuration
- `config/` - configuration files to be imported
- `content/` - default content (nodes, taxonomy terms, etc.)

### Directory Structure
- `recipes/` - Custom Drupal CMS recipes
- `web/` - Drupal document root
- `web/core/` - Drupal core
- `web/modules/contrib/` - Contributed modules
- `web/themes/contrib/` - Contributed themes
- `web/sites/default/` - Site-specific configuration

### Key Recipes
- `drupal_cms_starter` - Base CMS setup
- `drupal_cms_blog` - Blog content type and listing
- `drupal_cms_page` - Basic page content type
- `drupal_cms_events` - Event content type with dates/locations
- `drupal_cms_news` - News content type
- `drupal_cms_seo_tools` - SEO optimization features
- `drupal_cms_search` - Search functionality

### Content Architecture
- All content types extend from `drupal_cms_content_type_base`
- Common fields: `field_content`, `field_description`, `field_featured_image`, `field_tags`
- Uses Layout Builder for flexible page layouts
- Editorial workflow with content moderation

## Configuration Management
- Configuration is managed via recipes and exported to `config/` directories
- Use `drush cex/cim` for configuration import/export
- Recipe configuration uses YAML actions for programmatic updates

## AI Dashboard Module

This site includes a custom **AI Dashboard** module (`web/modules/custom/ai_dashboard/`) for tracking AI module contributions and development progress.

### Key Features

#### Content Types

    - `field_due_date` - When the issue should be fully completed
    - `field_additional_collaborators` - Additional team members working on this issue
  - Automatic import/update from drupal.org API with dependency parsing and AI Tracker metadata extraction

- **AI Resource Allocation**: Weekly time commitments per contributor

#### Calendar Dashboard
- **URL**: `/ai-dashboard/calendar`
- **Sorting**: AI Sponsors first, then alphabetical by company, then by developer name
- **Features**:
  - Weekly view with issue assignments
  - Drag-and-drop issue assignment
  - Backlog drawer with filtering
  - AI Sponsor badges (blue "SPONSOR" for sponsors, strikethrough for non-sponsors)
  - Company links to drupal.org profiles
  - Edit buttons for admins (⚙️ cog icon)
  - Sync buttons to pull drupal.org assignments
  - Developer focus and priorities display with PopperJS tooltips
  - Issue dependency tracking with "Blocked" labels and hover tooltips showing blocking issues

#### CSV Import System
- **URL**: `/ai-dashboard/admin/contributor-import`
- **Column Structure** (must match exact order):
  1. Name - Contributor's full name
  2. Username (d.o) - Drupal.org username (unique identifier)
  3. Organization - Company name
  4. AI Sponsor? - Yes/No for AI Sponsor status
  5. Tracker Role - Comma-separated roles (Developer, Front-end, Management, etc.)
  6. Skills - Comma-separated skills
  7. Commitment (days/week) - Weekly time commitment
  8. Company Drupal Profile - Company unique identifier for drupal.org URLs
  9. Current Focus - Brief description of current focus and priorities
  10. GitLab Username or Email - GitLab contact info

- **Re-import Capability**: Updates existing contributors/companies based on unique identifiers
- **Company Linking**: Uses `Company Drupal Profile` as primary unique identifier
- **Multi-role Support**: Handles comma-separated tracker roles with intelligent mapping
- **UTF-8 Support**: Automatically detects and converts file encoding to handle accented characters (e.g., Gábor Hojtsy)
- **Mac Excel Compatibility**: Handles Mac Roman encoding from Mac Excel CSV exports automatically

#### CSV Export Best Practices
For best results when exporting CSV from Google Sheets:

1. **Google Sheets** (Recommended workflow):
   - File → Download → Comma Separated Values (.csv) 
   - Upload directly to the importer **without opening in Excel**
   - This preserves UTF-8 encoding and handles accented characters perfectly

2. **Important**: **Do not open CSV files in Mac Excel** after downloading from Google Sheets
   - Opening in Mac Excel corrupts the UTF-8 encoding
   - This causes accented characters (á, ý, etc.) to display incorrectly
   - The importer includes automatic encoding fixes for common issues

#### Issue Import System
- **Deduplication**: Uses issue numbers as unique identifiers to prevent duplicates
- **Multi-status Import**: Handles multiple status filters without creating duplicates
- **Auto-update**: Updates existing issues when they change on drupal.org (with API delay)
- **Session Caching**: Prevents duplicates during single import session
- **AI Tracker Metadata Processing**: Automatically extracts structured metadata from issue summaries during import

#### AI Tracker Metadata Format
Issues must include structured metadata in their summaries using this exact format with HTML tags:
```
--- AI TRACKER METADATA ---
<strong>Update Summary: </strong>[One-line status update for stakeholders]
<strong>Check-in Date: </strong>MM/DD/YYYY (US format) [When we should see progress/get an update]
<strong>Due Date:</strong> MM/DD/YYYY (US format) [When the issue should be fully completed]
<strong>Blocked by:</strong> [#XXXXXX] (New issues on new lines)
<strong>Additional Collaborators:</strong> @username1, @username2
AI Tracker found here: <a href="https://www.drupalstarforge.ai/" title="AI Tracker">https://www.drupalstarforge.ai/</a>
--- END METADATA ---
```

- **Automatic Processing**: Metadata is extracted during issue import and stored in dedicated fields
- **Date Formats**: Supports MM/DD/YYYY format, converts to standard Y-m-d format
- **Issue References**: Blocked by field extracts issue numbers from #1234567 format
- **Collaborators**: Extracts usernames from @username format
- **Re-processing**: Use `drush aid-meta` to re-process metadata for all existing issues

### Project Kanban Features

### Deliverables Roadmap

#### Overview
The AI Dashboard includes a roadmap view (`/ai-dashboard/roadmap`) that tracks AI Deliverable tagged issues through their lifecycle.

#### Implementation Details
- **Route**: `/ai-dashboard/roadmap`
- **Controller**: `RoadmapController`
- **Template**: `ai-roadmap.html.twig`
- **CSS/JS**: `css/roadmap.css`, `js/roadmap.js`

#### Status Column Logic
Issues are organized into 4 columns based on status and assignment:
1. **Complete**: Issues with status `fixed`, `closed_fixed`, `closed_duplicate`, or `closed_works`
2. **Now**: Issues with assignees AND in a project (determined by tag matching or `ai_dashboard_project_issue` table)
3. **Next**: Issues with assignees but NOT in any project
4. **Later**: Issues with no assignees

#### Project Membership Detection
An issue is considered "in a project" if ANY of these conditions are met:
1. **Primary Deliverable**: Referenced in a project's `field_project_deliverable` field
2. **Explicit Ordering**: Has an entry in `ai_dashboard_project_issue` table (when manually ordered)
3. **Tag Matching**: Issue tags match any project tags (e.g., "strategic evolution" tag matches Strategic Evolution project)

#### Fields Displayed
- Issue title with link to drupal.org
- Short Description (`field_short_description`) - 255 char max, italicized
- Due Date (`field_due_date`) - Highlighted with yellow background
- Project link (if linked to a project)
- Progress bar (if project has sub-issues)
- Assignees (for Now/Next columns)

### Reports System

#### Reports Overview
- **URL**: `/ai-dashboard/reports` - Main reports listing page
- **Menu Location**: Under "Reports" in main navigation
- **Available Reports**: Import configurations status, untracked users analysis

#### Untracked Users Report
- **URL**: `/ai-dashboard/reports/untracked-users`
- **Purpose**: Identifies drupal.org users assigned to issues but not in the contributor database
- **Data Source**: `assignment_record` table entries where `assignee_id` is NULL but `assignee_username` exists

**Features**:
- **Date Filtering**: Filter by assignment date (This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last Month, Custom Range)
- **Organization Display**: Shows organization from drupal.org API (cached for 1 week)
- **Assignment Period**:
  - Single date shown as "Oct 3, 2025"
  - Two dates shown as "Sep 30, Oct 3, 2025" (indicates non-continuous)
  - Multiple dates listed up to 4, then shows range with day count for sparse assignments
- **CSV Export**: Copy-to-clipboard functionality for data export
- **Issue Links**: Each issue number links to both AI Tracker edit page and drupal.org

**Technical Details**:
- **Organization Fetching**:
  - Retrieves from drupal.org API `field_organizations` field collection items
  - Stores in `assignee_organization` field on assignment_record
  - Rate limited to 0.5s between API calls
  - Prioritizes current organizations from API response
- **Assignment Tracking**:
  - `assignee_username` and `assignee_organization` fields added to assignment_record entity
  - Organization captured at time of assignment for historical accuracy
  - Automatically populated during drupal.org sync operations
- **Performance**:
  - Organizations cached using Drupal State API with 1-week TTL
  - Database indexes on username and organization fields for query performance

## Field Customizations

### Tag Fields
Tag fields across all content types have been customized for clean UX:

- **Field Descriptions**: Removed from recipe configurations to eliminate helper text clutter
  - Files: `recipes/*/config/field.field.node.*.field_tags.yml`
  - Changed: `description: 'Include tags for relevant topics.'` → `description: ''`
  - Also updated: `recipes/drupal_cms_content_type_base/config/taxonomy.vocabulary.tags.yml`

- **Placeholder Text**: Removed from form display configurations to keep input fields clean
  - Files: `config/sync/core.entity_form_display.node.*.default.yml`
  - Changed: Removed `placeholder: ''` setting from all tagify widget configurations
  - Special case: `ai_issue` entity used `string_textfield` widget with placeholder `'e.g. AI Logging, June, Critical (comma separated)'` - also removed

- **Theme Setup**: Site uses **Gin theme** for both frontend and admin (not Olivero)
  - Frontend theme: `gin` 
  - Admin theme: `gin`

```

### Command Philosophy & Integration

- **`import-all` (Hourly Cron)**: Primary command for keeping data fresh
  - Handles new issues and updates automatically
  - Includes all processing (metadata, tags, assignments)
  - Fetches organizations for untracked users without existing data
  - Use `--full-from` to reprocess historical data and refresh organizations

- **Manual Commands**: For specific maintenance tasks
  - `process-metadata`: Reprocess AI Tracker metadata across all issues
  - `update-tag-mappings`: Reapply tag configurations to all issues
  - `update-organizations`: Fetch missing organization data

- **Data Processing Flow**:
  1. Issues imported from drupal.org
  2. Metadata automatically extracted from issue summaries
  3. Tag mappings applied based on configuration
  4. Assignments synced from drupal.org
  5. Organizations fetched for new untracked users

- **Performance Notes**:
  - Organization fetching includes API rate limiting (0.5s delay)
  - Cache used to avoid repeated API calls (1 week TTL)
  - `--full-from` clears cache for complete refresh

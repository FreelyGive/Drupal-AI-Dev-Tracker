# Codex_Branch.md

- Branch: `improved-site-wide-config-export`

- Purpose: Branch-specific notes and feedback from Codex. If this file appears on `main`, it can be ignored. If you are on a different branch than the one named above, this document may be overwritten with notes relevant to that branch.

- Coordination with Claude: Claude maintains a similar branch note file. In this repo, an existing file was detected: `CLAUDE-BRANCH.md`. Refer to that file for Claude’s branch plan and status; this Codex file complements it.

- Status: This document is informational only; no code or configuration changes were performed while adding/updating it.

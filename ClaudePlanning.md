# Claude Planning - AI Dashboard Module

This file serves as a **temporary planning workspace** for Claude Code when developing new functionality for the AI Dashboard module. Plans documented here should be **deleted once completed** and relevant information moved to permanent documentation.

## Purpose

- **Planning Workspace**: Document feature plans, technical approaches, and implementation strategies
- **Temporary Storage**: Keep work-in-progress plans that aren't ready for permanent documentation
- **Collaboration Tool**: Allow user review of plans before implementation begins
- **Clean Documentation**: Prevent permanent docs from being cluttered with incomplete or experimental ideas

## Usage Guidelines

### For Claude Code:
1. **Create detailed plans** for new features or significant changes
2. **Document technical approaches** with file paths, methods, and implementation details
3. **List prerequisites** and dependencies for complex features
4. **Get user approval** before proceeding with implementation
5. **Delete completed plans** and move relevant content to permanent documentation

### For Users:
1. **Review plans** before giving implementation approval
2. **Provide feedback** on technical approaches and priorities
3. **Request modifications** to scope or implementation strategy
4. **Confirm deletion** of completed plans once features are done

## Current Plans

(No active plans - ready for new feature planning)
